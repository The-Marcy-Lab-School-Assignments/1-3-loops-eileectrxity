# Question 2

Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i);
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but _without_ using the `break` statement?

# Answer

A way to achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop but without using a `break` statement is by using a `continue` statement instead.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) continue;
  console.log(i);
}
```

Here, the `continue` statement will skip the rest of the loop's body and continues with the next iteration, like the `break` statement would.
