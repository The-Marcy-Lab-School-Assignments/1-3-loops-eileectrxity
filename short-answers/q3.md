# Question 3

Look at this function:

```js
const bailOut = () => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i > 3) return;
    console.log("Inside the loop", i);
  }
  console.log("Outside the loop");
};
```

Is that `console.log('Outside the loop');` ever going to run? Why or why not?

# Answer

No, in the code, the `console.log('Outside the loop');` line will never run. The reason being that the moment the current index position, i, is greater than 3, the `if` statement will make the function return.

Anything that comes after `return` in a code will automatically be ignored. This means that the loop will only run for a total of 3 times, breaking out of the loop the second that index, i, is greater than 3.
